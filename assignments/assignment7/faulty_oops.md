### Breakdown of the Oops Message

1.  **Trigger**: The command `echo "hello_world" > /dev/faulty` initiated a `write` operation to the character device provided by the `faulty` kernel module.

2.  **Error Type**: `Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000`. This is the primary indicator of the problem. The kernel tried to write to memory address `0x0`, which is invalid. The `WnR = 1` (Write not Read) flag in the "Data abort info" confirms it was a write attempt.

3.  **Faulting Instruction**: The program counter (`pc`) register points to `faulty_write+0x10/0x20 [faulty]`. This means the crash occurred 16 bytes into the `faulty_write` function within our `faulty` module.

4.  **Call Trace**: The call stack shows the execution path from user space to the kernel driver:
    `write` syscall -> `vfs_write` -> `faulty_write`.
    This is the expected sequence for a file write operation being handled by a device driver.

### Root Cause

The crash is a classic NULL pointer dereference. The `faulty_write` function attempts to use a pointer that has a value of `NULL`. When it tries to write to the memory location pointed to by this `NULL` pointer, the hardware triggers a page fault, which results in this kernel oops because the kernel cannot resolve a write to address `0`.

This typically happens when a pointer is used before it has been initialized or allocated memory (e.g., via `kmalloc`).

### How to Fix

The fix involves inspecting the `faulty_write` function in the `faulty.c` source file. You must ensure that any pointer variable is assigned a valid memory address before it is dereferenced for a write operation. For a character driver's write function, this usually means allocating a kernel buffer with `kmalloc` before attempting to copy data into it from user space with `copy_from_user`.
